# Welcome to the contributing section 🤝

Flutter has given developers a super power to create innovative and creative UIs for Mobile and Desktop both 🦾. 

So why don't we create something awesome and contribute to Flutter community and also show the power or height of feasibility for creating beautiful things🤩 and if you want to contribute. than you are at the right place, here are the steps how you can contribute to this project!!

### 1. READ CODE OF CONDUCT
   Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clubgamma/code-of-conduct) before starting contributing.
### 2. Fork the repo
   First of all fork the repo to your own GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button on top-right corner. Still could not find 🙄,check the below image
   ![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94579238-360b6b00-0296-11eb-8dfd-c8ac8f10aa26.png)
   After a sucessful fork, you'll see a copy of this repo in your own account.

### 3. Clone the repo    
   Now it's time to copy this repo to own laptop/PC. 
   To clone the repo you can write the below command in **Git Bash**
    
   > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
    
   You can get the repo link from the Download section in the **repo copied in your own account**. Still having trouble🙄,see the below image
    
   ![clone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94578970-efb60c00-0295-11eb-93cc-301e605927bd.png)
   
 ### 4. Set up remote repo
  - When you cloned your fork, that should have automatically set your fork as the "origin" remote. Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your fork (which you copied in step 3) next to the word "origin". 
      If you don't see an "origin" remote, you can add it using below git command
    
    > git remote add origin <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
      
  - Now you have to setup **upstream**. For that write the below git command
      
    > git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/RiddlesWorld
        
  - Now pull the latest changes from original repo to your local changes by firing thee below command
        
    > git pull upstream master
  
 ### 5. Enough BoilerPlates, It's Flutter time now!!
  - Open cloned Project in your favourite IDE. After that go to the lib->categories. In categories choose the folder in which you want to create riddle and in that particular Category, create
    one folder named **(Categoryname + currentOrderNumber + @yourUserName)** . Boom, that's your playground, create your own riddle in it! Still not got it, don't worry, here is the example.
     
     ![FolderExample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94863822-afeb5200-0458-11eb-8e37-916d869b0739.png)
     
 - In that playground create as many files as you want, here is the [simplest file example](https://github.com/clubgamma/RiddlesWorld/blob/master/lib/categories/Math/math1%40jerry2501/math1HomePage.dart).
 
 **Visual Example:**
 
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94865538-66503680-045b-11eb-87ae-200b407077e2.png" width="200" height="400" />

   
 After Player complete the Riddle, You want to print the score of the player right👀, than you can use this [result file](https://github.com/clubgamma/RiddlesWorld/blob/master/lib/universal/result.dart) which is universal. It will take certain parameter, do check before using it!
   
  **Visual Example:**
 
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94865607-81bb4180-045b-11eb-8c9e-4d3938b89a56.png" width="200" height="400" />
   
   Use a universal AppBar throughout the application which is [here](https://github.com/clubgamma/RiddlesWorld/blob/master/lib/universal/riddleAppbar.dart).

 - After Creating your riddle, you have to go **MathRiddleLists.dart** file and call the **ActionCard** class which is already created. Pass the required argument like Name, description, orderNumber
   etc. In OnPressed, give the className which you have created just now in your playground, I mean in your folder😉 Example below!
   
   ![FileExample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94866704-76691580-045d-11eb-9859-09d56968ac46.png)
   
    **Visual Example:**
    
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57007680/94865382-1a9d8d00-045b-11eb-9e48-b1dad34da09a.png" width="200" height="400" />
   
   It is compulsory to keep the same layout for list of categories and list of Riddles in particular categories as sawn above.

   Boom, You have successfully added one Riddle🔥✨
